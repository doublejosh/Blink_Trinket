Make rainbows when you dance.
=============

Use a force sensor to control LEDs via a Trinket micro controller. LED strand will chase rainbow
colors around skipping pixels to save batteries and create movement. Color moves the opposite
direction of apparent light movement. Brightness reduction configuration also helps save batteries.
Includes a sensitivity input adjustment with a potentiometer.
